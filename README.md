# Python_Game
A totally sweet game made in python

The goal of this game is to run down the field as the running back, while avoiding the defenders.
You will have 4 downs, to get as far as possible. The downs reset every touchdown.
Control the running back using the WASD keys.
In addition, you can control Pistol Pete at the bottom of the screen using your mouse.
Pistol Pete can shoot at the defenders to clear a path for the running back.
